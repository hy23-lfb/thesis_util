Practical advices
-------------------
1. Log the error values at the end of each epoch. Plotting these values across epochs would hint us if the model is overfitting or underfitting.
	- Learning curves.
2. Data points should be scaled around 0 i.e., [-1, 1].
3. Refer the figures in this paper to learn how to plot multiple findings in one graph.
