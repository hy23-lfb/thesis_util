We also provide a probabilistic version of our prediction network which can be
sampled during the testing time to calculate uncertainties in the predicted deformations. 

While computation time may not be overly critical for imaging studies of moderate size,
rapid registration approaches are needed to (i) allow for interactive analysis, to (ii) allow
their use as building blocks for more advanced image analysis algorithms; and to (iii) time-
and cost- efficiently analyze very large imaging studies.

Deformable image registration, which is a key component of many medical
image analysis systems.

Uncertainty quantification: We extend our network to a Bayesian model which is
able to determine the uncertainty of the registration parameters and, as a result,
the uncertainty of the deformation field. This uncertainty information could be
used, e.g., for uncertainty-based smoothing [21], or for surgical treatment
planning, or could be directly visualized for qualitative analyses.

Correction network: Furthermore, we propose a correction network to increase
the accuracy of the prediction network. Given a trained prediction network, the
correction network predicts the difference between the ground truth momentum
and the predicted result. The difference is used as a correction to the predicted
momentum to increase prediction accuracy. Experiments show that the correction
network improves registration results to the point where optimization-based and
predicted registrations achieve a similar level of registration accuracy on
registration validation experiments.
