Dear Mr Yogeshappa,
 
please find enclosed the application form for the thesis.
 
In the first step, please sign it in the space provided. Afterwards, you can determine your topic together with your supervisor and enter it on the sheet. After the signatures of the first examiner and the examination board have been obtained, you will determine your start date together with your supervisor. This should be after the signature of the examination board, as the topic of the thesis is not considered approved until this signature has been made. In the last step, the sheet is sent back to the ZPA (usually by the institute) so that the thesis can be registered in RWTHonline.
From this point on, you can view the registration as well as your submission date under "My achievements".
 
Please be patient and understand that the whole process is currently more elaborate, so it may take some time until you can view the registration.
 
Once you are finished writing the thesis, please submit three printed and bound copies of the thesis to the institute. The ZPA does not require a version of your thesis.
 
Please remember to submit the Statutory Declaration in Lieu of an Oath to the ZPA no later than the date you submit your thesis. If you are using the combined logo on the cover page of your thesis, please submit the logo application to the institute along with your work.
 
In addition, if your exams are not currently sorted into the correct catalogs, please contact me promptly regarding receipt of the arrangement sheet.
 
Freundliche Grüße
Felicia Schaffhausen
