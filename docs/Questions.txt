Q1. Voxelmorph is already an image registration paper. How would our paper be unique to publish it as a paper on its own? All we are doing is to train the network on new images. Isn't it?

Q2. How to ensure that the images we are receiving from a lab form the same distribution?
    "The parameters of the network, i.e. the convolutional kernel weights, can be optimized using only a training set of volumes from the dataset of interest. The procedure learns a common representation that enables alignment of a new pair of volumes from the same distribution."
        - Voxelmorph paper.


Q3. What are Diffeomorphic transformations? Is this different from Elastix transformations?
    "Diffeomorphic transforms model φ through the integral of a velocity vector field, preserving topology and maintaining invertibility on the transformation [9]."
        - Voxelmorph paper.

Q4. Papers to read 40, 41, {42}, [43], [44]; [] - segmentation driven; {} - spatial transformation network.

Q5. In Voxelmorph paper, all the image samples have the same dimensions. Should we also ensure that? Or, should we make the network more robust to random image dimensions?

Q6. " Indeed, the resulting deformation can be interpreted as simply an approximation or initialization to the optimal deformation φ, and the resulting difference is sometimes referred to as the amortization gap [15], [66]".
        If the actual result depend on the initialization of the deformation field then would it make sense to train the network in a supervised fashion to learn the network parameters, and then use it for unsupervised methods?
