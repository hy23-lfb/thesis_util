5. There are different datasets like "Genelia" for e.g.
6. Initially, we will club all of them into one training set and see the result.
7. Based on it, maybe, we might have to construct a different network for different datasets.
	- This is something that cannot be commented on, in general. It needs to be verified through experiments.
8. Where to place landmarks and how to place or who shall place them shall be decided in the next meeting.
